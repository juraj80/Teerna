# Teerna

Teerna is a Game Master tool developed with Node and React


### Development

This project is actually made of two distinct applications: the client and the server.

Client is built with React.js. You can find it in the `client` folder and you can install its dependencies with `cd client && yarn install`.

Server is built with Node.js and Express. You can find it in the `server` folder and you can install its dependencies with `cd server && yarn install`.

#### Useful commands

- Update the project: `git pull && cd server && yarn install && cd ../client && yarn install && cd ..`
- Download all branches at once: `git fetch`
- Handling merges: `git mergetool` ([Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) is a nice GUI tool to merge files. If you have it installed this command will open it.)
